vcompile_all_fpga.do : is the main script file for verilog compiling before a modelsim simulation. It is used by CMAKE to create the building tree. The CMAKE rule is set in sw/CMakeLists.txt
                       this script calls all the scripts needed to compile PULP ips and the top modules (cluster and soc)
                       
some files are not used.

to simulate the FPGA design this libraries are needed (see fe/sim/scripts/vcompile_all_fpga.do):
 secureip
 simprims_ver
 unifast
 unifast_ver
 unimacro 
 unimacro_ver 
 vmp unisim 
 unisims_ver
 
the script in fpga/xilinx_lib_compiling compiles them.
