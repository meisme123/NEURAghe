\chapter{Control and Status Registers}

\rvcore does not implement all control and status  registers specified in the
\riscv privileged specifications, but is limited to the registers that were
needed for the PULP system.
The reason for this is that we wanted to keep the footprint of the core as low
as possible and avoid any overhead that we do not explicitely need.
