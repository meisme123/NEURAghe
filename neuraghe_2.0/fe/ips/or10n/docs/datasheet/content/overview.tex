\chapter{Overview}

\orion is a 4-stage in-order OpenRISC CPU. The ISA of \orion was extended to
also support multiple additional instructions including hardware loops,
pre-/post-increment load and store instructions, vectorial instructions
(microSIMD) and bit manipulation instructions that were not part of the original
OpenRISC ISA.
\orion supports misaligned data memory accesses which are not mandatory by the
OR1k specifications.

\orion was designed for the PULP platform which is why it contains registers and
instructions that are of limited use for a single-core system, e.g. the core ID
special-purpose register.

Figure~\ref{fig:or10n_overview} shows a block diagram of the core.
