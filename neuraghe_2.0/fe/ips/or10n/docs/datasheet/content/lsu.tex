\chapter{Load-Store-Unit (LSU)}

The LSU of the core takes care of accessing the data memory. Load and stores on
words (32 bit), half words (16 bit) and bytes (8 bit) are supported. For loads
the loaded operands are sign- or zero-extended based on the instruction used,
i.e. \instr{l.lhz} vs. \instr{l.lhs}.

Table~\ref{tab:lsu_signals} describes the signals that are used by the LSU.


\begin{table}[H]
 \caption{LSU Signals}
 \label{tab:lsu_signals}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}llX@{}} \toprule
    \textbf{Signal}               & \textbf{Direction} & \textbf{Description} \\ \toprule
    \signal{data\_req\_o}         & \textbf{output}    & Request ready, must stay high until \signal{data\_gnt\_i} is high for one cycle \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_addr\_o[31:0]}  & \textbf{output}    & Address \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_we\_o}          & \textbf{output}    & Write Enable, high if we want to write, low if we want to read \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_be\_o[3:0]}     & \textbf{output}    & Byte Enable, is set for the bytes to write/read \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_wdata\_o[31:0]} & \textbf{output}    & Data to be written to memory \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_rdata\_i[31:0]} & \textbf{input}     & Data read from memory \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_rvalid\_i}      & \textbf{input}     & \signal{data\_rdata\_i} is valid. This signal must always be identical to \signal{data\_gnt\_i} delayed by one cycle. \\ \hline
    \signal{data\_gnt\_i}         & \textbf{input}     & The memory accepted the request and will answer in the next cycle with valid rdata \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{Misaligned Accesses}
The LSU is able to perform misaligned accesses, meaning accesses that are not
aligned on natural word boundaries. However it needs to perform two separate
word-aligned accesses internally.
This means that at least two cycles are needed for misaligned loads and stores.


\section{Pre-/Post-Increment Load and Stores}

Pre- and post-incrementing load and store instructions are supported on OR10N.
While performing the load and store to the data memory, the address is increased
by the offset that is applied to the base address and saved in the base address
register.


\section{Protocol}
\label{sec:lsu_protocol}

The protocol that is used by the LSU to communicate with a memory works as
follows:
The LSU provides a valid address in \signal{data\_addr\_o} and sets
\signal{data\_req\_o} high. The memory then answers with a \signal{data\_gnt\_i}
set high as soon as it is ready to serve the request. This may happen in the
same cycle as the request was sent or any number of cycles later. After a grant
was received, the address may be changed by the LSU without impact. Also the
\signal{data\_wdata\_o}, \signal{data\_we\_o} and \signal{data\_be\_o} signals
may be changed as it is assumed that the memory has already processed that
information. In the case of a read, the memory answers with a
\signal{data\_rvalid\_i} set high when \signal{data\_rdata\_i} is valid. This
may happen one cycle after the grant was received, but may take any number of
cycles after the grant was received.
Starting from the cycle when \signal{data\_rvalid\_i} was asserted, another
request may be sent.

Figure~\ref{fig:lsu_trans_basic}, Figure~\ref{fig:lsu_trans_b2b} and
Figure~\ref{fig:lsu_trans_slow} show timing diagrams of the protocol.
