* Mixed signal test bench
this is a test bench combining the digital hdl code with the analog 
netlist of the driver and monitor for a mixed signal simulation using 
Mentor Graphics questa ADMS.

** Usage
The test bench is controlled with a makefile, the following options 
are available:
1) make without options: cleans the directory, recreates the digital 
   and analog libraries and compiles the digital and analog parts. 
2) make digital: compiles the digital part
3) make analog: compiles the analog part

After compilation the simulation can be started using the vasim command. 
Select the combinedanalog_tb entity as well as the combinedanalog.cmd file 
during initialization of the simulation.
