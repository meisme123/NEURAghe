***** About *****

The present LaTeX report template (framework) has been designed to run
on the workstations of the Integrated Systems Laboratory (IIS) out of
the box. Nevertheless, the structure, in general, can be used with any
TeX distribution running on an arbitrary operating system (minor
changes might be required within the editor of your choice). The
template is intended to serve as an example for both semester projects
and master theses. Hence, you will have to make some changes in order
to fit your requirements.


***** Quick Start *****

*) If you are interested in what the present LaTeX report results in,
just take a look at the PDF file in the root directory of the
framework:

   > acroread report_template.pdf

*) Next, you should test whether you can compile the provided
framework using the following command:

   > make all

This will re-build the whole output files (incl. some intermediate
files).

*) If you only want to (re-)build the PDF, run the following command:

   > make pdf

*) Actually - THAT'S IT! The report contains a recommended chapter
structure and some general comments concerning the contents of each
chapter.

*) You may want to take a look at the appendix of the output file,
since there you can find some tips on LaTeX and writing in general,
which might be useful for you.

*) More information about the LaTeX framework for reports can be found
on the DZ Wiki at:

*) Feel free to modify the whole framework according to your
wishes. Happy TeXing!!
