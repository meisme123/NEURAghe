\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%TODO

I would like to thank my supervisors Michael Gautschi, Antonio Pullini and Luca
Benini for giving me the opportunity to work on such a huge project and for
their advice during the course of this thesis.
I want to thank Eric Flamand for his work on proposing instruction set
extensions for OpenRISC and his support during evaluation and implementation in
RTL.
For his work on the LLVM compiler support for our platform and advice during
the evaluation of possible extensions I would like to thank Michele Beretta,
who was also a source of inspiration for ideas on how to improve our platform
in terms of infrastructure.
For his helpful advice and infrastructure support at ETH I would like to thank
Frank G\"urkaynak,
and last but not least everyone else in the PULP team and in the Integrated
Systems Lab that has supported me during this thesis.
