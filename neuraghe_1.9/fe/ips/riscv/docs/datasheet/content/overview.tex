\chapter{Overview}

\rvcore is a 4-stage in-order \riscv CPU. The ISA of \rvcore was extended to
also support multiple additional instructions including hardware loops,
post-increment load and store instructions and packed-SIMD instructions that
were not part of the standard \riscv ISA.

Figure~\ref{fig:ri5cy_overview} shows a block diagram of the core.
