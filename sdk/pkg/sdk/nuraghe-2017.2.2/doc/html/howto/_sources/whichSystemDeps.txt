What must be configured before using or compiling the SDK
--------------------------------------------------------------

Artifactory access
..................

Toolchains and SDK releases are deployed on the artifactory server in order to quickly get prebuilt versions without having to recompile them.

Before accessing the server, the user and password must be properly configured with the following environment variable: ::

  $ export PULP_ARTIFACTORY_SERVER=pulp:<password>

The password can be retrieved from the pulp_pipeline top module sources (at git@iis-git.ee.ethz.ch:pulp-sw/pulp_pipeline.git): ::

  $ cat bin/ci.py | grep "pulp:"

When the SDK is retrieved through the downloader, it is downloading using wget without any user / password setting, thus the best way is to add a file .wgetrc in your home folder containing the following: ::

  user=pulp
  password=<password as above>


Linux distribution
..................

The SDK should work on Ubuntu 14 or 15, Centos 6 or 7 and Linux Mint.

The binary packages retrieved from the artifactory server are compiled for a specific Linux distribution and so you must get the appropriate one.
The packages are currently compiled for Ubuntu 14 and Centos 6 and as they are compatible all the Linux and Mint distributions are mapped to Ubuntu 14 and all Centos distributions are mapped to CentOS 6.

This will differ in the future as for example some Ubuntu versions won't be compatible together. When this happens, there will be an automatic mapping to the right distribution that should work most of the time. In case it does not work and you want to force the version of the packages, you can define the following environment variable: ::

  $ export PULP_DISTRIB=<package distrib>

The possible values are curently Ubuntu_14 or CentOS_6.

System packages
...............

Here are the list of packages that you have to install starting from a fresh Ubuntu 15.10 distribution: ::

  $ sudo apt-get install git g++ python3-setuptools swig3.0 python3-dev libjpeg-dev libz-dev cmake lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 ant openjdk-7-jdk
  $ sudo easy_install3 artifactory jenkinsapi sqlalchemy prettytable

The following packages are also needed to fully compile the SDK: ::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-sphinx man-db pexpect texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra doxygen

.. sphinxcontrib-programoutput

.. And for Centos: ::

.. TODO

..   $ sudo yum install bzip2-devel
..   Make sure Python3 is compiled after bz2-devel is installed
