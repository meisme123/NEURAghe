How to dump UDMA channels
-------------------------

This is a feature available only on the virtual platform in order to dump into a file all the data that goes through a specific channel.

How to activate it
..................

This feature can be controlled through the **--periph-dump** option like in this example: ::

  make run PLT_OPT="--periph-dump=spim0Tx:$PWD/spim0Tx.txt"

This option takes a value which specifies first the channel name to be dumped, and second the file path where it should be dumped, separated by a colon.

Several options can be specified in order to dump several channels: ::

  make run PLT_OPT="--periph-dump=spim0Tx:$PWD/spim0Tx.txt --periph-dump=spim0Rx:$PWD/spim0Rx.txt"


How to get the channel name
...........................

The channel name depends on the target architecture. The best way to get those names is to first dump UDMA traces, and to identify the interesting channels in the traces: ::

  make run PLT_OPT="--gv-trace-file=stdout --gv-trace=udma"


Specific peripherals
....................

A few peripherals provide specific options in order to get the data that goes through them, in order to get better formatted data.

Here is an example for the UART which disables the dump of transmitted data to the standard output and instead redirect it to a file: ::

	make run PLT_OPT="--uartFile=$PWD/uart.txt"
