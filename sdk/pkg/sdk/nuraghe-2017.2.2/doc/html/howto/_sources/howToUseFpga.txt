How to use the FPGA
-------------------

As for the RTL, there are 2 ways to use the FPGA

Let the SDK flow manage the bitstreams
......................................

The bistream for each supported chip is stored as a binary package in the artifactory server. When the SDK dependencies are retrieved, the correct bitstream is downloaded according to the configuration.

First the SDK must be properly initialized and configured for the FPGA (see :ref:`howtoSetupSdk`).

Then you must download the bitstream for your architecture with this command: ::

  $ plpbuild --p sdk deps

Now go to your application and execute this command to upload the bitstream to the FPGA: ::

  $ make bistream

After this step you can use the FPGA as any other platform with the usual commands: ::

  $ make clean all run

Provide an external bitstream
.............................

In case the bitstream for the chip you are using is not available or you want to synthesize it yourself, you can compile and run your application the usual way, just adding the following option: ::

  $ make clean all run PLT_OPT=--emu-mapping=miaemu.bit.bin

Tips
----

When you launch a make command for the FPGA, you can specify the IP address of the FPGA with this option: ::

  $ make clean all run PLT_OPT=--emu-addr=192.168.0.10

In case the FPGA requires a username and a password, the username can be put in the address by replacing it with <username>@<address> and the password can be avoided by uploading an SSH key.

The address can also be configured through an environment variable to make it more permanent: ::

  $ export PULP_EMU_ADDR=192.168.0.10
