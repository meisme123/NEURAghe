Platforms
=========

The Pulp SDK supports the following platforms which can be specified when an application is compiled and run:

  * **Virtual platform**. This is a functional simulator that can emulate the full Pulp chip connected to the peripherals, so that a full application can be run on this platform without any modification. The models also contain timing models so that the applications can also be benchmarked.

  * **RTL platform**. Applications can be run on RTL simulations of Pulp architectures.

  * **FPGA**. 

  * **Boards**. The SDK contains the scripts needed to run applications on the boards containing a Pulp chip.
