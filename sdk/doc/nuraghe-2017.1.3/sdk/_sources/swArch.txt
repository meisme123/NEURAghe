It is organized with the following layers, from the bottom to the top:

  * **HAL**. This is the lowest layer that gives access directly to the hardware. It mainly provides a set of functions that abstract the access to the registers.

  * **Runtime**. This layer provides a set of common services such as memory allocation, scheduling, etc. 

  * **Drivers**. This contains a set of drivers to ease the access to the peripherals.

  * **OpenMP**. This provides an implementation of the OpenMP standard to help parallelizing code on the cluster.

  * **Libraries**. This contains high-levels libraries such as kernels.
