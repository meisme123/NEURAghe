How to setup the SDK
--------------------

Environment setup
.................

Whatever the way the SDK was retrieved (through downloader or from top module) or produced (from source), a setup file has been generated in the env folder that can be sourced to setup the terminal to be used with the SDK.

The file to source should look like *env/env-sdk-<version>.sh*. Just source it and you can then compile and run an application

Configuration setup
...................

If you don't configure anything else, the applications will be compiled and launched for the default configuration. In case you want to specify a different configuration, you can define the following environment variable with the desired configuration: ::

  $ export PULP_CONFIGS=pulpChip=mia:platform=rtl

The next time you launch an application, it will be compiled for Mia Wallace and run on the RTL platform.

Tips
....

A tool will soon be provided in order to know what are the possible configurations. Here are a few interesting ones:

- pulpChip:      mia, pulp4, GAP, fulmine, pulp3 ...
- pulpCoreArchi: or1k, or10n, or10nv2, riscv, ri5cyv1, ri5cyv2, ri5cyv2-rvc ...
- pulpCompiler:  gcc, llvm
- platform:      gvsoc, fpga, rtl
