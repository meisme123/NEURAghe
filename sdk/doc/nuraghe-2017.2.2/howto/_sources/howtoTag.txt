How to tag the whole stuff
--------------------------

Specifications tag
.................

The first thing to do is to tag the specifications. The name depends on the chip:

  - GAP is currently tagged this way: gap-<day>-<month>-<year>. If several tags must be done the same day, the day is like this <day>_<number>

The specifications must be pushed to the corresponding git repository and tagged in it using the tag name described above.

For GAP the repository is git@iis-git.ee.ethz.ch:pulp-project/GAP-specifications.git



RTL tag
.......

Once the specs are tagged, the RTL can be tagged several tags with the same specs to reflect the various implementations of the same specs.

The convention for the tag name is the following <specs tag>-rtl-<build number>.

For example if the specs tag is gap-07-09-2016, the first RTL tag for it will be gap-07-09-2016-rtl-0.

The last number can be incremented everytime there is a new RTL tag of the same specs.



SDK tag
.......

The convention is the same as for RTL except that it is sdk instead of rtl. Thus for the example above the first tag name would be gap-07-09-2016-sdk-0.
